00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:06.480
Hello.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/15-0
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.200
Very good.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/20-0
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.870
Hi.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/24-0
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.410
I'm doctor Chao Chen.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/46-0
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.941
And the lecturer in quantitative
Social Research in the School of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/46-1
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:06.170
Social Sciences at the Burbank
University of London.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/65-0
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.542
In this video I will provide a
practical overview of multiple

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/65-1
00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:11.640
linear regression.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/93-0
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.766
I'm going to start by using the
bivariate regression to review

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/93-1
00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:24.248
the core concept and the
mathematical properties of the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/93-2
00:01:24.248 --> 00:01:25.740
linear regression model.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/133-0
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.430
I also explain how social
researchers view the data

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/133-1
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.842
analytical objectives of linear
regression in different ways,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/133-2
00:01:34.842 --> 00:01:38.827
and how different views of
linear regression model were

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/133-3
00:01:38.827 --> 00:01:39.610
influenced.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/176-0
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.574
Our understanding and
interpretation, our review of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/176-1
00:01:43.574 --> 00:01:47.986
the linear regression model,
where then addressed the key

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/176-2
00:01:47.986 --> 00:01:52.169
assumptions we need, as well as
the main principles of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/176-3
00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:56.580
statistical inference when it
comes to linear regression.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/191-0
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.542
Next, I will discuss the
underlying rationale for

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/191-1
00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:03.320
multiple linear regression.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/212-0
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.557
Why has multiple over
multivariate linear regression

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/212-1
00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:13.490
become the most common way of
understanding the social world?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/231-0
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.327
What issues do we have to
consider when we try to build a

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/231-1
00:02:17.327 --> 00:02:19.220
multiple linear regression
model?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/263-0
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.885
I will finish the discussion
here by highlighting some basic

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/263-1
00:02:25.885 --> 00:02:29.573
principles on when we try to
design and implement our

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/263-2
00:02:29.573 --> 00:02:32.100
multiple linear regression
analysis.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/289-0
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.267
The most important key takeaway
lesson from this video is to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/289-1
00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:43.132
recognize all statistical models
are only approximations of the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/289-2
00:02:43.132 --> 00:02:43.740
reality.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/307-0
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.662
There is no perfect statistical
model, although we do have some

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/307-1
00:02:48.662 --> 00:02:50.310
very general principles.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/343-0
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.799
We can follow and yet for any
quantitative social researcher,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/343-1
00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.205
we still have to make a lot of
decisions and very often list

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/343-2
00:02:59.205 --> 00:03:02.890
decisions may not have a clear
answer or solution.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/368-0
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.980
As food by George Box, all
models are wrong, but some of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/368-1
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.760
them are useful bugs.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/401-0
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.137
Is one of the most important
statisticians of all time and

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/401-1
00:03:16.137 --> 00:03:20.801
the least particular line has
become one of the most important

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/401-2
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:24.280
motors for quant researchers
around the world.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/462-0
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.663
Regression analysis is a very
common statistical technique and

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/462-1
00:03:43.663 --> 00:03:48.654
regression analysis allows us to
represent major and estimate the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/462-2
00:03:48.654 --> 00:03:53.493
statistical relationship between
different factors or variables

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/462-3
00:03:53.493 --> 00:03:57.425
in the social world or human
society and the linear

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/462-4
00:03:57.425 --> 00:04:02.037
regression model is just one of
the regression techniques we

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/462-5
00:04:02.037 --> 00:04:02.340
use.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/538-0
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.406
However, the linear regression
model is perhaps the most widely

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/538-1
00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:13.092
used model because it provides
us with a very straightforward

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/538-2
00:04:13.092 --> 00:04:17.400
and intuitive means to achieve
the objective I have just

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/538-3
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.086
mentioned linear regressions
allows us to use a simple linear

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/538-4
00:04:22.086 --> 00:04:26.091
function to present the
correlation between X&amp;Y,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/538-5
00:04:26.091 --> 00:04:30.324
which often can be very
complicating real life and very

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/538-6
00:04:30.324 --> 00:04:35.312
often in may not be realistic to
present the correlation with the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/538-7
00:04:35.312 --> 00:04:36.370
straight line.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/544-0
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.540
Consider this linear function.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/609-0
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.957
We will talk about multiple
linear regression in a minute,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/609-1
00:04:44.957 --> 00:04:49.133
but let us focus on bivariate
linear regression. For now to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/609-2
00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:52.892
illustrate some of the core
concept, and mathematical

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/609-3
00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:57.277
properties of linear regression
by very linear regression that

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/609-4
00:04:57.277 --> 00:05:01.106
only has one predictor or
independent variable and the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/609-5
00:05:01.106 --> 00:05:02.220
linear function.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/619-0
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.012
We can use X to represent the
predictor and Y to represent the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/619-1
00:05:07.012 --> 00:05:09.670
outcome or the dependent
variable.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/632-0
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.750
Some researchers also call why
the response variable.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/636-0
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.000
As you see in the textbook.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/666-0
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.136
And here with this particular
linear function defined, we can

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/666-1
00:05:23.136 --> 00:05:27.520
use the value of X to derive the
corresponding value of Y.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/691-0
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.158
When we take a random error or
disturbance into consideration,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/691-1
00:05:32.158 --> 00:05:36.790
which is the third term or the
final term in a linear function?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/711-0
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.085
The linear regression model also
has other components we have to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/711-1
00:05:45.085 --> 00:05:46.690
consider very carefully.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/746-0
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.874
So first, when we carry out any
linear regression analysis on,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/746-1
00:05:51.874 --> 00:05:55.885
the idea is to use one or more
predictors or independent

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/746-2
00:05:55.885 --> 00:05:58.490
variables to predict the value
of Y.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/770-0
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.037
Once we use our data to estimate
the Intercept and the slope,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/770-1
00:06:04.037 --> 00:06:08.180
then we can use the data we have
to to predict the why.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/814-0
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.161
That's another way to think
about that and the error or

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/814-1
00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:16.700
disturbance turned here is part
of the render noise that cannot

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/814-2
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.884
be captured or explained by the
predictors we include in a

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/814-3
00:06:20.884 --> 00:06:21.310
model.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/832-0
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.044
Formally speaking, the error or
disturbance is defined as the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/832-1
00:06:26.044 --> 00:06:29.160
difference between the actual
and predicted outcome.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/875-0
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.201
So once we put the error term
aside, in addition to the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/875-1
00:06:36.201 --> 00:06:40.143
predictor and the outcome
variable in the linear model,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/875-2
00:06:40.143 --> 00:06:44.295
the model is defined by the
intercept and the slope on the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/875-3
00:06:44.295 --> 00:06:45.070
right hand.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/895-0
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.433
The intercept of the linear
function or linear linear

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/895-1
00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:51.950
regression model will tell us
the corresponding value of.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/907-0
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.920
Why when we set the value of X
and 0?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/946-0
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.411
On one hand, the intercept of a
linear function or a linear

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/946-1
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:09.650
regression model will tell us
the corresponding value of Y

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/946-2
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.950
when we set the value of X at 0.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/957-0
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.220
And ignored the Brendan error.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/993-0
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.453
The slope on the other hand,
indicates the corresponding

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/993-1
00:07:20.453 --> 00:07:24.547
change in the value of Y when we
increase the value of X by 1

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/993-2
00:07:24.547 --> 00:07:26.330
unit, say from zero to one.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1009-0
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.059
And the important thing here is
to recognize, given that this is

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1009-1
00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:32.120
a linear function.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1039-0
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:38.999
So I do when we move X from zero
to one or when we move X from

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1039-1
00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:45.180
one to two, we should get the
same corresponding change in.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1042-0
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:45.840
Why?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1070-0
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.856
Which means umm for this
particular linear regression

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1070-1
00:07:49.856 --> 00:07:53.730
model the slope is constant is a
constant change in?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1091-0
00:07:53.740 --> 00:08:00.052
Why whenever we move X by 1
unit, regardless of the initial

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1091-1
00:08:00.052 --> 00:08:01.210
value of X?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1111-0
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.598
Once again, he will have to
ignore the random error and the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1111-1
00:08:07.598 --> 00:08:08.540
OR disturbance.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1124-0
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.550
You can see this easily by
working on the algebra.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1149-0
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:30.066
Here you can see what the linear
regression model looks like, but

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1149-1
00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:31.930
we only consider one predictor.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1166-0
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.285
The model uses beta zero and
beta one to represent the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1166-1
00:08:36.285 --> 00:08:38.700
intercept and slope
respectively.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1183-0
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:44.125
These figure is very helpful
because it clearly shows where

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1183-1
00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:45.840
the Intercept is located.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1197-0
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.910
Once again, the Intercept is the
value of our of our independent

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1197-1
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:50.420
variable.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1214-0
00:08:54.850 --> 00:09:00.270
Once again, the Intercept is the
value of our dependent variable.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1260-0
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:05.066
When we set the value of our
predictor at zero, the slope

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1260-1
00:09:05.066 --> 00:09:10.348
shows the corresponding changes
in Y over changes in X and when

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1260-2
00:09:10.348 --> 00:09:15.794
the denominator of this fraction
is 1, then the slope tell us how

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1260-3
00:09:15.794 --> 00:09:16.950
much our this.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1277-0
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.358
How much are the dependent
variable would change when we

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1277-1
00:09:22.358 --> 00:09:24.690
increase the value of our
predictor by 1 unit?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1308-0
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.525
Here's a more realistic or
concrete example to show how a

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1308-1
00:09:37.525 --> 00:09:41.152
social researcher can apply
linear regression to study the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1308-2
00:09:41.152 --> 00:09:41.890
social work.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1329-0
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:46.526
As a reminder, this is a scatter
plot containing both the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1329-1
00:09:46.526 --> 00:09:49.190
predictor and the dependent
variable.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1356-0
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.182
The predictor in this case is
the competence scores for

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1356-1
00:09:53.182 --> 00:09:57.060
democratic politicians and the
US created by the researchers.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1381-0
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.836
The scores range between zero
and one, with higher value

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1381-1
00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:06.454
representing more perceived
competence of the given

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1381-2
00:10:06.454 --> 00:10:07.220
politician.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1417-0
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.007
The dependent variable is how
much percentage of votes the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1417-1
00:10:12.007 --> 00:10:16.161
democratic politicians can win
relative to the vote share of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1417-2
00:10:16.161 --> 00:10:18.000
the Republican politicians.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1441-0
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.522
Each small circle in a scatter
plot represents a observation

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1441-1
00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:26.770
likely to be an election in a
data set.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1458-0
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.264
We can then carry out linear
regression analysis to estimate

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1458-1
00:10:31.264 --> 00:10:34.720
the intercept and the slope of
the regression line.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1500-0
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.345
Looking at the regression line,
it is apparent that democratic

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1500-1
00:10:42.345 --> 00:10:46.140
politicians can win more votes
relative to their Republican

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1500-2
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.620
rivals when their voters
consider them more competent.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1512-0
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.430
Let's get the plot here.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1521-0
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.000
Also shows where the Intercept
is located.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1569-0
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.459
Since the intercept is negative,
now we know when voters consider

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1569-1
00:11:01.459 --> 00:11:05.508
Democratic politicians having no
competence at all, they will

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1569-2
00:11:05.508 --> 00:11:09.752
lose a lot of votes against the
Republican politicians, and this

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1569-3
00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:11.320
particular scatter plot.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1584-0
00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.140
It can also see there is a small
hat about alpha.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1609-0
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.417
This is a common notation
researchers use to represent any

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1609-1
00:11:20.417 --> 00:11:23.930
statistical metric estimated
based on the data.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1623-0
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:29.790
The correct way to read author
hat here will be the estimated

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1623-1
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.650
intercept.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1653-0
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.514
Likewise, the scatterplot also
uses one of the data points or

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1653-1
00:11:35.514 --> 00:11:39.600
observations to remind us of the
definition of a residual.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1675-0
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:45.008
You can see small hats being
placed on predictive why and the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1675-1
00:11:45.008 --> 00:11:46.520
residual epsilon here.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1688-0
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.582
Residual can be defined as the
estimated error or estimated

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1688-1
00:11:51.582 --> 00:11:53.820
disturbance using our data.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1702-0
00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.751
Finally, regression line has a
very interesting mathematical

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1702-1
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:02.090
fact.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1749-0
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.949
The mean values of the predictor
and the mean values of the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1749-1
00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:09.906
dependent variable will always
be on the regression line and we

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1749-2
00:12:09.906 --> 00:12:13.677
are not going to explain too
much where there is a case, but

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1749-3
00:12:13.677 --> 00:12:16.150
this is something you can keep
in mind.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1776-0
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.764
So now you know linear
regression is a very convenient

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1776-1
00:12:28.764 --> 00:12:32.401
technique for us to understand
the statistical relationship

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1776-2
00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:34.220
between two or more variables.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1783-0
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.880
So summarize our discussion so
far.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1798-0
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.919
I would say the main objective
of using linear regression is

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1798-1
00:12:40.919 --> 00:12:41.430
twofold.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1824-0
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.748
First, linear regression allows
us to use the linear function to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1824-1
00:12:47.748 --> 00:12:51.063
represent the correlation
between the predictor and the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1824-2
00:12:51.063 --> 00:12:52.070
outcome variable.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1835-0
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.890
2nd and this is where things
become more interesting.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1868-0
00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.176
The least squares linear
regression analysis will allow

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1868-1
00:13:00.176 --> 00:13:04.649
us to estimate the values of the
Intersect and the slopes with

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1868-2
00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:06.850
some very desirable properties.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1892-0
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.170
I will discuss these
probabilities.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1902-0
00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.450
I will discuss this properties
in a minute.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1921-0
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.278
So you may have heard
researchers often use different

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1921-1
00:13:21.278 --> 00:13:22.590
names to call X&amp;Y.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1937-0
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.061
So far we have used the
predictor to coax, but doing so

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1937-1
00:13:27.061 --> 00:13:28.270
actually implies.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1963-0
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.808
A very important assumption
about why we need a linear

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/1963-1
00:13:34.808 --> 00:13:38.380
regression and what we use
linear regression for first.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2013-0
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.953
Also, in line with those who
invented the basic techniques of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2013-1
00:13:42.953 --> 00:13:47.040
linear regression in the 1st
place 100 years ago, we can use

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2013-2
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.327
the linear regression model for
forecasting using the same case

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2013-3
00:13:51.327 --> 00:13:54.610
we have just gone through in the
previous slide.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2036-0
00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:00.204
It is tempting that we can use a
politicians competent score to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2036-1
00:14:00.204 --> 00:14:03.240
predict their performance in the
elections.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2071-0
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:08.397
Of course, this is a very strong
and perhaps unrealistic

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2071-1
00:14:08.397 --> 00:14:13.890
scenario, because a politicians
on performance in the elections,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2071-2
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:18.370
or how many votes these
politicians going to get is.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2091-0
00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:24.390
Very unlikely to be a function
of a single factor or variable.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2112-0
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.638
Sometimes election may just be
influenced by random noise or

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2112-1
00:14:28.638 --> 00:14:32.550
random disturbance that we do
not know, or we cannot measure.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2153-0
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:40.700
But in any case, if you believe,
or if you prefer the main data

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2153-1
00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.337
analytical objective of linear
regression is for casting, then

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2153-2
00:14:45.337 --> 00:14:49.237
X should we understood as a
predictor of our outcome

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2153-3
00:14:49.237 --> 00:14:49.900
variable?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2173-0
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.251
Likewise, some researchers
believe we can use the model to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2173-1
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:57.390
explain the outcome of our
interest.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2227-0
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.342
Using the same example, so
instead of saying we want to use

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2227-1
00:15:02.342 --> 00:15:06.944
competence to predict on the
politicians performance in the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2227-2
00:15:06.944 --> 00:15:11.700
elections, it may be the case
that, you know, we can just use

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2227-3
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.456
a politician's competence to
explain their performance in the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2227-4
00:15:16.456 --> 00:15:17.760
elections, right?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2239-0
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.160
In the case, we may not know
very much about, you know.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2297-0
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.809
Ohh, we don't care very much
about competence being the most

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2297-1
00:15:24.809 --> 00:15:28.091
important predictor of a
politician's performance, but

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2297-2
00:15:28.091 --> 00:15:31.969
it's it is certainly one of the
very important factors we should

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2297-3
00:15:31.969 --> 00:15:35.489
we should consider when we try
to explain, you know, their

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2297-4
00:15:35.489 --> 00:15:38.890
vote, the number of votes they
receive in the elections.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2303-0
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.380
So in this case.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2317-0
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.440
X is better to be understood as
a explanatory variable.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2333-0
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.854
Finally, before I move on to
discuss this statistical

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2333-1
00:15:54.854 --> 00:15:56.820
inference of linear regression.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2348-0
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.510
I also would like to make one
point very clear.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2416-0
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.897
The slope we estimate using
different regression techniques,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2416-1
00:16:08.897 --> 00:16:13.875
including the list of squares
linear regression model is only

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2416-2
00:16:13.875 --> 00:16:18.853
one way for us to measure the
correlation between X&amp;Y and

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2416-3
00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:23.831
you should have studied other
techniques to major or estimate

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2416-4
00:16:23.831 --> 00:16:29.050
the coalition between different
variables in other quant modules

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2416-5
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.860
and also with certain
assumptions.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2431-0
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:35.916
The slope we estimate can
actually tell us the causal

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2431-1
00:16:35.916 --> 00:16:36.780
effect of X.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2465-0
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.864
We will talk more about this
later this term, but just

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2465-1
00:16:40.864 --> 00:16:44.829
remember in the field of causal
inference, X is usually

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2465-2
00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:48.440
understood as the cause or the
treatment variable.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2522-0
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.304
Now, given that we are clear
about the basic setup and the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2522-1
00:17:01.304 --> 00:17:05.176
data analytical objectives of
linear regression at this time

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2522-2
00:17:05.176 --> 00:17:08.921
to address the question of
statistical inference, that is,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2522-3
00:17:08.921 --> 00:17:12.792
how do we estimate the intercept
and slope using the data we

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2522-4
00:17:12.792 --> 00:17:13.110
have?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2553-0
00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.097
If we apply a linear regression
techniques, especially Lisa

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2553-1
00:17:19.097 --> 00:17:24.142
squares, and how can we know the
intercept and slope we estimate

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2553-2
00:17:24.142 --> 00:17:25.540
are the best ones?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2579-0
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:32.256
The ordinary leases squares or
or less is one of the most

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2579-1
00:17:32.256 --> 00:17:35.690
common techniques we used to do
the job.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2648-0
00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:40.566
They intercept and the slope
estimated using OS has some very

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2648-1
00:17:40.566 --> 00:17:45.198
nice properties and one of the
most important properties is

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2648-2
00:17:45.198 --> 00:17:50.062
ohls can produce unbiased point
estimates or unbiased estimate

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2648-3
00:17:50.062 --> 00:17:54.849
of the intercept and slopes,
which means oh Alice can give us

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2648-4
00:17:54.849 --> 00:17:59.481
the estimated intercept and
slope close to the real or true

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2648-5
00:17:59.481 --> 00:17:59.790
one.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2712-0
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:05.000
Remember, our data is always a
sample of some well defined or

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2712-1
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.439
unknown population and with some
assumptions or conditions we can

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2712-2
00:18:09.439 --> 00:18:13.407
be more or less confident that
the estimated intercept and

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2712-3
00:18:13.407 --> 00:18:17.174
slopes produced by OS can be
very similar to you if not

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2712-4
00:18:17.174 --> 00:18:21.210
exactly the same as the true
intercept and the slope in the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2712-5
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:21.950
population.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2726-0
00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.170
The first condition is quite
self explanatory.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2751-0
00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.528
To use linear regression that
has always indicated that we

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2751-1
00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:36.036
assume there exist a linear
statistical leadership between

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2751-2
00:18:36.036 --> 00:18:37.820
the predictor and the outcome.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2768-0
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.375
Next, we need the error of each
observation to be independent

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2768-1
00:18:43.375 --> 00:18:44.350
from each other.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2782-0
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.082
For instance, if we are trying
to use the number of hours you

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2782-1
00:18:48.082 --> 00:18:48.410
study.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2792-0
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.830
Two predicted the final.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2804-0
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.330
Mark, you're going to receive 4
advanced quants.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2835-0
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.227
The arrow over the the procedure
of one student should not depend

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2835-1
00:19:16.227 --> 00:19:19.380
on the residual or the error of
another student.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2861-0
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.848
Meanwhile, at the same time we
need the value of Y to be

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2861-1
00:19:23.848 --> 00:19:28.030
normally distributed across
different levels or values of X.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2889-0
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.657
In other words, the value of Y
recorded in the data set given a

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2889-1
00:19:33.657 --> 00:19:37.556
specific value or level of X
should be included in the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2889-2
00:19:37.556 --> 00:19:40.250
corresponding normal
distribution of.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2932-0
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.229
Why at the same level of value
or level of acts, but finally we

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2932-1
00:19:45.229 --> 00:19:50.043
need the variance or standard
error of the dependent variable

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2932-2
00:19:50.043 --> 00:19:54.158
to be equal across different
values or levels of the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2932-3
00:19:54.158 --> 00:19:55.090
predictor X?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2960-0
00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:00.781
In a textbook, decode is
conditioned equal variance and a

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2960-1
00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:05.613
more technical or or fashioned
term for this condition is

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2960-2
00:20:05.613 --> 00:20:06.780
homoskedastic.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2977-0
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:18.239
So now you know the assumptions,
but there's one thing you need

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2977-1
00:20:18.239 --> 00:20:18.620
to know.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/2987-0
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:21.080
These are the conditions for.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3001-0
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:26.540
Ohh, let's to produce unbiased
estimated intercept and slope.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3072-0
00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.462
This conditions do not
necessarily allow the oil as to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3072-1
00:20:31.462 --> 00:20:35.751
produce efficient estimates to,
say a point estimate is

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3072-2
00:20:35.751 --> 00:20:40.116
efficient is to say these
estimates do not have a lot of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3072-3
00:20:40.116 --> 00:20:45.018
variance or standard error and
the variance over standard error

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3072-4
00:20:45.018 --> 00:20:49.920
of a point estimate usually has
more to do with the statistical

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3072-5
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.290
power or more specifically the
sample size.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3086-0
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.470
This is what we know based on
the central limit theorem.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3108-0
00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.382
Very often we can reduce the
variance over standard error of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3108-1
00:21:00.382 --> 00:21:03.630
our regression estimate by
increasing the sample size.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3126-0
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.074
This particular scatter plot
shows the conditions we have

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3126-1
00:21:12.074 --> 00:21:12.890
just described.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3137-0
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.310
Again, this is a bivariate
linear regression.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3157-0
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.852
Each small black dot in a
scatter plot is a data point or

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3157-1
00:21:20.852 --> 00:21:21.850
a observation.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3189-0
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:27.548
The sheep blue straight line
says the values of white can be

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3189-1
00:21:27.548 --> 00:21:32.208
modeled or approximated by a
linear function of X which is

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3189-2
00:21:32.208 --> 00:21:35.210
the linearity assumptions we we
need.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3263-0
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.545
Next, although it is a bit hard
to see here, the distance

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3263-1
00:21:41.545 --> 00:21:45.252
between each black dot and a
blue regression line does not

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3263-2
00:21:45.252 --> 00:21:48.835
seem to have a clear pattern,
and it definitely does not

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3263-3
00:21:48.835 --> 00:21:52.103
depend on each other, which
means the residual of 1

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3263-4
00:21:52.103 --> 00:21:55.873
particular data pointer has
nothing to do with the residual

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3263-5
00:21:55.873 --> 00:21:59.330
of another data point in this
particular scatter plot.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3268-0
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.080
The condition is then the
independence assumption.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3300-0
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.368
Furthermore, you can see that
across different levels of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3300-1
00:22:09.368 --> 00:22:13.622
values of X, the values of Y our
dependent variable follow the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3300-2
00:22:13.622 --> 00:22:15.310
same normal distribution.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3313-0
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.911
The red curves in the scatter
plot demonstrate the normality

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3313-1
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:19.530
assumption.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3342-0
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.561
Finally, given that they follow
the same know, what distribution

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3342-1
00:22:25.561 --> 00:22:29.302
even though the mean is that
different position along with

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3342-2
00:22:29.302 --> 00:22:30.000
the Y axis?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3373-0
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:37.648
We can still see that the errors
have the same variance or

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3373-1
00:22:37.648 --> 00:22:41.120
standard errors across different
levels or values of Y.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3402-0
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:46.381
Is the case of homoscedasticity
the reason for us to say so is

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3402-1
00:22:46.381 --> 00:22:50.897
because a normal distribution is
defined by its mean and

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3402-2
00:22:50.897 --> 00:22:51.610
variance.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3439-0
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.381
So even though two normal
distribution will have different

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3439-1
00:22:56.381 --> 00:23:01.122
means, umm, they will look
really similar or even identical

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3439-2
00:23:01.122 --> 00:23:06.100
to each other if they they are
variance is very close similar.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3511-0
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:23.124
The reason for us to say so is
because I know what distribution

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3511-1
00:23:23.124 --> 00:23:26.584
is defined by its mean and
variance, so to say, to know

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3511-2
00:23:26.584 --> 00:23:30.352
what distributions at different
mean value identical is also

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3511-3
00:23:30.352 --> 00:23:33.998
saying they have the same
variance, which is the condition

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3511-4
00:23:33.998 --> 00:23:36.840
again for equal variance or
homoscedasticity.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3516-0
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.850
All the scholars will combine.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3539-0
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:45.475
Often, scholars will combined
independence, normality and

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3539-1
00:23:45.475 --> 00:23:49.060
homoscedasticity assumptions to
say the outcome variable.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3545-0
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.140
Why for any OS?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3575-0
00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:56.056
For oil, let's to produce
unbiased estimates must be

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3575-1
00:23:56.056 --> 00:24:00.609
independent and identically
distributed across all levels or

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3575-2
00:24:00.609 --> 00:24:02.550
values of the predictor X.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3584-0
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.610
This is also known as a ID
condition.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3625-0
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:19.335
It is important to highlight
that these assumptions and

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3625-1
00:24:19.335 --> 00:24:23.298
conditions are very important as
we hope to obtain biased

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3625-2
00:24:23.298 --> 00:24:27.670
estimates for the intercept and
slopes of the linear regression

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3625-3
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:28.080
model.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3648-0
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:32.709
However, the violation of these
assumptions is by no means the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3648-1
00:24:32.709 --> 00:24:33.700
end of the world.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3696-0
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:40.060
Quanta researchers in the past
decades have invented a lot of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3696-1
00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:44.848
statistical techniques we can
use to adjust or correct our

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3696-2
00:24:44.848 --> 00:24:49.878
point estimates when one or more
of these assumptions are not

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3696-3
00:24:49.878 --> 00:24:50.690
satisfied.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3732-0
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.423
For instance, generalized linear
models are useful if our data do

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3732-1
00:24:55.423 --> 00:24:58.898
not allow for linearity,
assumption or other assumptions

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3732-2
00:24:58.898 --> 00:25:01.520
we are going to cover in the
coming weeks.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3761-0
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.537
After all, the relationship
between acts and why it's not

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3761-1
00:25:05.537 --> 00:25:09.217
always linear, it's actually a
very strong and unrealistic

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3761-2
00:25:09.217 --> 00:25:12.460
assumption about how the social
world really works.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3858-0
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:19.834
There are also other statistical
techniques we can use to relax

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3858-1
00:25:19.834 --> 00:25:23.438
the the assumptions when we
conduct the regression analysis

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3858-2
00:25:23.438 --> 00:25:27.162
and we are not going to cover
this techniques in this module,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3858-3
00:25:27.162 --> 00:25:30.766
but we are very welcome to
request additional references if

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3858-4
00:25:30.766 --> 00:25:34.670
you want to know more about any
of these techniques and I should

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3858-5
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:38.274
also highlight that the list
here, the list of techniques I

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3858-6
00:25:38.274 --> 00:25:41.457
put here is by no means
comprehensive, they are just

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3858-7
00:25:41.457 --> 00:25:43.680
some examples for you to
understand.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3923-0
00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:48.601
You know they have different
techniques for us to address the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3923-1
00:25:48.601 --> 00:25:53.591
situation of when the data we
have may violate the assumptions

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3923-2
00:25:53.591 --> 00:25:58.660
we have for or less and we may
have to use alternative modeling

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3923-3
00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:03.571
choice or we may have to use
some more advanced techniques to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3923-4
00:26:03.571 --> 00:26:05.710
adjust our standard errors.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3934-0
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.690
So we can produce value
statistical inference.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3945-0
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.060
Now we are clear about the
assumptions.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3960-0
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.692
It is time for us to discuss the
more important issues of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3960-1
00:26:23.692 --> 00:26:24.890
regression analysis.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/3971-0
00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.710
How do we obtain useful
information from our analysis?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4010-0
00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.719
Sure, the regression analysis,
especially the least squares,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4010-1
00:26:32.719 --> 00:26:36.388
may produce unbiased point
estimates of the intercept and

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4010-2
00:26:36.388 --> 00:26:40.057
slope over slopes when we
include more than one predictor

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4010-3
00:26:40.057 --> 00:26:40.880
in the model.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4044-0
00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:47.014
But it is very important and
crucial for us to review some of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4044-1
00:26:47.014 --> 00:26:51.590
the key principles when it comes
to, umm, statistical inference.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4061-0
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:56.772
And this video in this review,
I'm going to focus on two very

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4061-1
00:26:56.772 --> 00:26:57.700
important issues.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4084-0
00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.013
And 1st I'm going to address the
question of statistical

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4084-1
00:27:02.013 --> 00:27:06.249
significance and next I'm going
to briefly explain the question

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4084-2
00:27:06.249 --> 00:27:07.110
of model fit.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4152-0
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:15.477
First, after we carry out any
linear regression analysis,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4152-1
00:27:15.477 --> 00:27:19.846
we're very keen to find out if
the pointer estimate is

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4152-2
00:27:19.846 --> 00:27:24.453
statistically significant or
not, given that intercept of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4152-3
00:27:24.453 --> 00:27:29.378
very often does not have too
much substantive implications on

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4152-4
00:27:29.378 --> 00:27:34.542
here, our discussion will focus
on the estimated slope or better

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4152-5
00:27:34.542 --> 00:27:34.860
hat.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4193-0
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.451
So to determine whether the
estimate is slow as

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4193-1
00:27:39.451 --> 00:27:43.641
statistically significant or
not, we will have to conduct a

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4193-2
00:27:43.641 --> 00:27:47.203
hypothesis testing and you
should have learned the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4193-3
00:27:47.203 --> 00:27:51.043
rationale or procedures of
hypothesis testing in other

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4193-4
00:27:51.043 --> 00:27:52.580
modules by this point.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4223-0
00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:01.964
Do you hypothesis testing for or
less is basically A2 tailed test

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4223-1
00:28:01.964 --> 00:28:06.460
because we want to use ohh like
to estimate the slope.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4239-0
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:09.560
The value of the slope or the
correlation between X&amp;Y.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4271-0
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.658
The null hypothesis is always
greater equals zero, and the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4271-1
00:28:13.658 --> 00:28:16.920
alternative hypothesis will be
beta is not zero.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4318-0
00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:21.919
By saying our estimated slope is
statistically significant is

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4318-1
00:28:21.919 --> 00:28:25.503
basically to say either the
estimated beta is 6

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4318-2
00:28:25.503 --> 00:28:29.909
statistically different from
zero, or to say we can reject

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4318-3
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:34.240
the null hypothesis which which
plants fade out equals 0.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4324-0
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.560
For this goal.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4343-0
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.460
We can either use the P value or
the confidence intervals.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4405-0
00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.640
If we use the P value, which is
a conditional probability that

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4405-1
00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.761
we observe the pattern in the
data we have given that the null

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4405-2
00:29:00.761 --> 00:29:04.948
hypothesis is true, we will need
this particular probability to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4405-3
00:29:04.948 --> 00:29:09.134
be really, really low for us to
say that no hypothesis is still

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4405-4
00:29:09.134 --> 00:29:12.470
an unlikely to be real, and we
should reject this.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4430-0
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:19.158
If you think this concept is
very confusing, which is very

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4430-1
00:29:19.158 --> 00:29:22.770
true because it requires a lot
of thinking, ohh.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4457-0
00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.470
When you learn the hypothesis,
testing another alternative for

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4457-1
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:29.457
statistical reference,
especially when it comes to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4457-2
00:29:29.457 --> 00:29:33.030
statistical significance, is to
use the confidence interval.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4511-0
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:40.460
If we want to use counters
interval then we will have to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4511-1
00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:44.669
assume first that distribution
of this particular estimate or

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4511-2
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:48.878
beta is normally distributed and
then we can use the standard

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4511-3
00:29:48.878 --> 00:29:52.341
error of this particular
estimate to construct the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4511-4
00:29:52.341 --> 00:29:53.020
intervals.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4518-0
00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.820
The key idea is to make sure.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4557-0
00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:03.300
Depending on the level of
statistical counters you want to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4557-1
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.953
choose, this interval should not
include zero, so we can reject

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4557-2
00:30:07.953 --> 00:30:11.080
the null hypothesis that beta
equals zero.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4593-0
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:15.243
Before I continue, I should
stress that statistical

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4593-1
00:30:15.243 --> 00:30:19.193
significance is not the only
thing we should pay attention to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4593-2
00:30:19.193 --> 00:30:23.080
when it comes to statistical
inference of linear regression.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4665-0
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:28.297
In addition to statistical
significance, we should also pay

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4665-1
00:30:28.297 --> 00:30:33.009
close attention to the sign and
the size of the point estimate

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4665-2
00:30:33.009 --> 00:30:37.272
or estimate is slope because a
statistically significant

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4665-3
00:30:37.272 --> 00:30:41.610
estimated slope maybe so small
in terms of its size, that

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4665-4
00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:46.023
eventually our predictor only
has a trivial correlation or

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4665-5
00:30:46.023 --> 00:30:48.940
causal effect on the outcome
variable.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4706-0
00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:06.266
And when it comes to statistical
significance, whenever it comes

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4706-1
00:31:06.266 --> 00:31:09.944
to statistical inference, we
should also pay attention to the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4706-2
00:31:09.944 --> 00:31:11.250
question of model fit.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4771-0
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:15.870
There are many techniques to
evaluate whether or not the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4771-1
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:20.374
proposed model is a good fit to
the data, and which one would

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4771-2
00:31:20.374 --> 00:31:23.788
use would demand a clear
conceptualization and

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4771-3
00:31:23.788 --> 00:31:28.292
operationalization of goodness
of fit a very common indicator

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4771-4
00:31:28.292 --> 00:31:32.795
we use is our squared, and I put
the formal expression of our

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4771-5
00:31:32.795 --> 00:31:33.740
squared here.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4808-0
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:42.942
Us clear by thematically can be
represented as a fraction of the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4808-1
00:31:42.942 --> 00:31:47.874
variance of the predicted
outcome over the variance of the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4808-2
00:31:47.874 --> 00:31:49.880
actual come in the data.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4831-0
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:56.550
The idea here is to make sure
this friction is as close as as

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4831-1
00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:57.980
possible to one.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4865-0
00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:02.816
So we can say the model has done
a good, very good job accounting

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4865-1
00:32:02.816 --> 00:32:07.060
for the variance of why, which
is the outcome of interest.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4878-0
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:11.420
We can also calculate the sum of
squared procedures.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4902-0
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:16.895
Sometimes we just use excess R
to see if the model performs

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4902-1
00:32:16.895 --> 00:32:21.555
well by correctly predicting the
outcome variable, which requires

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4902-2
00:32:21.555 --> 00:32:22.120
us some.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4935-0
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:30.129
Which requires the residual of
each observation or data point

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4935-1
00:32:30.129 --> 00:32:34.330
to be as small as possible, or
less, or the list of squares.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4962-0
00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:39.501
Linear regression is known to
generate estimated intercept and

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4962-1
00:32:39.501 --> 00:32:43.270
slope such that we will have the
smallest Sr.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4978-0
00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:48.130
That's why they get the name of
Lisa Square being a regression.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4996-0
00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:54.382
That's why they get the name of
the least squares linear

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/4996-1
00:32:54.382 --> 00:32:55.110
regression.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5023-0
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.233
So far we have used bivariate
linear regression to review the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5023-1
00:33:07.233 --> 00:33:10.270
key concept and the principles
of linear regression.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-0
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:15.587
Because the concept and the
principles I have just explained

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-1
00:33:15.587 --> 00:33:19.499
so far can be extended to
multiple regression relatively

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-2
00:33:19.499 --> 00:33:23.137
well and multiple linear
regression is basically the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-3
00:33:23.137 --> 00:33:26.501
linear regression model,
including more than one

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-4
00:33:26.501 --> 00:33:30.139
predictor or independent
variables, what will linear

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-5
00:33:30.139 --> 00:33:33.914
regression using the least
squares has become the most

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-6
00:33:33.914 --> 00:33:38.170
powerful regression technique
because it allows us to present

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-7
00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:42.151
a very complicated interactive
dynamics between different

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-8
00:33:42.151 --> 00:33:46.133
predictors on regarding the
outcome or dependent variable

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-9
00:33:46.133 --> 00:33:49.496
and we can formally and
mathematically present a

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-10
00:33:49.496 --> 00:33:53.821
multiple linear regression in
many ways, one of which requires

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-11
00:33:53.821 --> 00:33:58.351
some knowledge of linear algebra
to simplify our discussion, here

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-12
00:33:58.351 --> 00:34:02.675
is a really quick representation
without using any complicated

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5149-13
00:34:02.675 --> 00:34:03.980
mathematical tools.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5183-0
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:08.790
The only notation in this
particular equation you should

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5183-1
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:13.263
know ohh the notation that may
look unfamiliar to you is the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5183-2
00:34:13.263 --> 00:34:17.150
subscript attached to each slope
and each predictor.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5197-0
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:23.680
Here the number basically means
different slopes and predictors.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5249-0
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:28.144
For instance, X1 means on the
1st predictor and the better one

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5249-1
00:34:28.144 --> 00:34:32.456
is the first slope associated
with X one the first predictor

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5249-2
00:34:32.456 --> 00:34:36.769
in the model and OK basically
means the number of predictors

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5249-3
00:34:36.769 --> 00:34:40.445
we want to put in this
particular linear regression

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5249-4
00:34:40.445 --> 00:34:40.870
model.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5306-0
00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:49.798
Multiple linear regression is
not so different from bivariate

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5306-1
00:34:49.798 --> 00:34:53.980
linear regression again, but now
we have to consider the meaning

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5306-2
00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.969
of slopes with a bit of more
caution for any estimated slope,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5306-3
00:34:57.969 --> 00:35:01.571
it can be understood in
different ways, again depending

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5306-4
00:35:01.571 --> 00:35:03.180
on how you view the data.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5314-0
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:06.040
Analytical objectives of
regression analysis.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5346-0
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:10.606
However, in the case of multiple
linear regression, we can see

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5346-1
00:35:10.606 --> 00:35:14.287
any particular slope is
estimated by our yes, with the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5346-2
00:35:14.287 --> 00:35:18.370
correlation or causal effect of
other predictors being taken

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5346-3
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:19.240
into account.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5371-0
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.608
Consider the example where we
investigated a correlation

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5371-1
00:35:25.608 --> 00:35:29.387
between a politicians perceived
the competence and their

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5371-2
00:35:29.387 --> 00:35:31.310
performance in the elections.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5406-0
00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:36.307
Say we want to include another
predictor or independent

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5406-1
00:35:36.307 --> 00:35:40.068
variable in the model and a list
variable can be the economic

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5406-2
00:35:40.068 --> 00:35:42.920
situation of the the politicians
constituency.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5445-0
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:48.035
Once we include both predictors,
then the estimated slope of the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5445-1
00:35:48.035 --> 00:35:52.509
competence score variable should
be understood as the correlation

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5445-2
00:35:52.509 --> 00:35:56.372
between competence and a
politician's performance in the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5445-3
00:35:56.372 --> 00:35:57.050
elections.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5472-0
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:03.090
Why a weak control four or
accounting for the influence of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5472-1
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.820
the economic situation in the
politicians constituency?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5482-0
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:09.350
Because it is possible that once
we account for.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5491-0
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:15.980
A constituencies economic
situation.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5497-0
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:18.790
And politicians perceived
competence.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5509-0
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.263
Where have little to do with
their performance in the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5509-1
00:36:21.263 --> 00:36:21.720
elections.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5516-0
00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:26.240
When we know it is possible.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5559-0
00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.963
To include more than one
predictor in the linear

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5559-1
00:36:31.963 --> 00:36:35.052
regression model, which
variables we should include and

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5559-2
00:36:35.052 --> 00:36:38.306
how these variables relate to
each other in the model post

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5559-3
00:36:38.306 --> 00:36:41.230
become very important questions
we have to consider.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5593-0
00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.010
Many quantum researchers
dedicated their career to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5593-1
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:49.827
studying the questions of model
and variable selection and the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5593-2
00:36:49.827 --> 00:36:53.220
model selection basically
involves the discussion about

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5593-3
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.250
model comparison.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5637-0
00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:58.583
Model comparison is a very
important type to pursue, but

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5637-1
00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:02.852
model comparison will not be a
our focus here because many

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5637-2
00:37:02.852 --> 00:37:07.120
model comparison techniques
often require more assumptions

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5637-3
00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:11.461
and this techniques are also
very often subject to a lot of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5637-4
00:37:11.461 --> 00:37:12.040
debates.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5652-0
00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.902
So we are going to focus on the
question regarding variables

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5652-1
00:37:18.902 --> 00:37:19.470
selection.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5712-0
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.672
So As for variable selection,
the key first is to avoid or

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5712-1
00:37:24.672 --> 00:37:29.214
meeting any crucial predictors
regarding that when the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5712-2
00:37:29.214 --> 00:37:34.334
variable, because it is likely
that the estimate is love of 1

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5712-3
00:37:34.334 --> 00:37:39.619
predictor will become trivial or
statistically insignificant in

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5712-4
00:37:39.619 --> 00:37:44.740
terms of on the estimated slope
of the predictor will become.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5755-0
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:52.636
As for variable selection, the
key is to avoid omitting any

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5755-1
00:37:52.636 --> 00:37:56.081
important predictors regarding
the dependent variable of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5755-2
00:37:56.081 --> 00:37:59.525
interest, as it is likely that
the estimate is slow or a

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5755-3
00:37:59.525 --> 00:38:00.130
predictor.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5800-0
00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.649
Because it is very likely that
the estimate is slow of a

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5800-1
00:38:07.649 --> 00:38:11.904
predictor will become trivial in
terms of the size, and will no

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5800-2
00:38:11.904 --> 00:38:15.627
longer be statistically
significant once we account for

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5800-3
00:38:15.627 --> 00:38:16.890
all the predictors.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5818-0
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.739
Quantum Resources will focus on
statistical learning and causal

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5818-1
00:38:21.739 --> 00:38:22.370
inference.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5859-0
00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.973
Have proposed some very useful
criteria or techniques for us to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5859-1
00:38:26.973 --> 00:38:30.974
choose variables in the
regression model and we will not

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5859-2
00:38:30.974 --> 00:38:35.116
have the opportunity to cover
umm, more advanced tools for

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5859-3
00:38:35.116 --> 00:38:36.380
various selection.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5886-0
00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:40.080
But you should know this is a
really exciting field and a lot

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5886-1
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.590
of people have dedicated their
career to study this question.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5913-0
00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:50.179
As we include one of 1 variable
in a linear regression model, it

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5913-1
00:38:50.179 --> 00:38:53.410
is also very important which do
not include two predictors.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5952-0
00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.413
That are highly correlated with
each other, because doing so

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5952-1
00:38:59.413 --> 00:39:02.925
will make our models or our
predictions or our estimation

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5952-2
00:39:02.925 --> 00:39:06.014
unstable, which means the
estimated slopes will be

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5952-3
00:39:06.014 --> 00:39:06.680
misleading.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5957-0
00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.110
Or unreliable?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/5965-0
00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.310
This is the issue of
collinearity.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6001-0
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.740
We have to consider and we can
use the various inflation factor

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6001-1
00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:19.194
as a possible benchmark to
detect the presence of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6001-2
00:39:19.194 --> 00:39:20.990
collinearity in the model.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6011-0
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.756
Or we can just check the
pairwise correlation of your

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6011-1
00:39:24.756 --> 00:39:25.440
predictors.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6044-0
00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:34.914
I also want to highlight
sometimes having more predictors

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6044-1
00:39:34.914 --> 00:39:37.661
may actually be
counterproductive, because

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6044-2
00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:41.494
having more predictors were
artificially increase the value

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6044-3
00:39:41.494 --> 00:39:42.580
of the R-squared.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6131-0
00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:48.236
So R-squared will no longer
serve as a useful indicator of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6131-1
00:39:48.236 --> 00:39:53.774
your model field and the trusted
our square in this case is more

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6131-2
00:39:53.774 --> 00:39:59.397
useful to address this situation
because our squared and just our

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6131-3
00:39:59.397 --> 00:40:04.253
square, the difference between
them is adjusted R square

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6131-4
00:40:04.253 --> 00:40:09.110
include one additional term in a
formula to penalize to.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6136-0
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:14.720
By penalizing I mean to reduce
the value of R square as you

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6136-1
00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.400
include more predictors in the
model.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6173-0
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.447
So the inclusion of more than
one predictor in the model can

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6173-1
00:40:28.447 --> 00:40:31.617
also allow us to study more
complicated statistical

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6173-2
00:40:31.617 --> 00:40:35.030
relationships, some of which can
actually be nonlinear.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6210-0
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:40.680
No, we were talking more about
this when we cover our general

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6210-1
00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:46.017
less linear model, but we can do
so either by, say, considering

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6210-2
00:40:46.017 --> 00:40:50.270
the interaction term, the model,
or the quadratic.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6224-0
00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:55.820
Or the quadratic or polynomial
term in a model.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6254-0
00:40:56.670 --> 00:41:00.055
A linear function with
interaction term will allow us

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6254-1
00:41:00.055 --> 00:41:03.880
to have some dependency between
different predictors, so the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6254-2
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.260
estimate is love of 1.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6267-0
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.567
Predictor can change under
different situations given by

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6267-1
00:41:08.567 --> 00:41:10.360
another predictor in the model.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6303-0
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.807
For instance, maybe the
correlation between political

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6303-1
00:41:13.807 --> 00:41:16.999
competence and the election
results will change when we

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6303-2
00:41:16.999 --> 00:41:20.533
consider the economic structure
of a constituency which, say,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6303-3
00:41:20.533 --> 00:41:22.870
can be either agriculture or
industrial.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6316-0
00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:27.050
This is also a very good
example.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6332-0
00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:31.719
In the there is also a very good
example in the textbook for you

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6332-1
00:41:31.719 --> 00:41:32.580
to consider.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6367-0
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:38.600
A linear function would say
quadratic or polynomial term

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6367-1
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.610
basically allows the predictor
to have a nonlinear relationship

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6367-2
00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:44.740
with with the dependent
variable.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6382-0
00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:51.120
And you will see one example in
the next slide.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6439-0
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:54.856
So here's is the interesting
question we have to ask

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6439-1
00:41:54.856 --> 00:41:58.754
ourselves if multiple linear
regression actually allow us to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6439-2
00:41:58.754 --> 00:42:02.205
include more complicated
interactive dynamics between

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6439-3
00:42:02.205 --> 00:42:06.231
different predictors such that
the statistical relationship we

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6439-4
00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:10.320
are trying to study is no longer
linear, then why do we need to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6439-5
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.110
generalize the linear model?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6449-0
00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.970
Where we're going to talk more
about this?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6462-0
00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:20.265
Uh, when next week when we
discuss generalized linear

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6462-1
00:42:20.265 --> 00:42:20.630
model.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6484-0
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.965
But here is the intuition,
generalized Lydia model actually

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6484-1
00:42:24.965 --> 00:42:28.370
allows to relax more assumptions
of Lisa squares.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6492-0
00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.190
Linear regression in addition to
Lee.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6495-0
00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:32.730
Linearity assumption.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6506-0
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:38.870
In addition to the linearity
assumption.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6524-0
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:49.892
Here is a quick example of a
linear function with quadratic

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6524-1
00:42:49.892 --> 00:42:50.350
terms.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6531-0
00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.780
In this case, we set the
INTERCEPT as.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6585-0
00:42:56.430 --> 00:43:00.907
So here's a quick example of a
linear function that would say

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6585-1
00:43:00.907 --> 00:43:05.385
polynomial term because we have
X to the power of two, and in

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6585-2
00:43:05.385 --> 00:43:10.007
this case we set the intercept
at one and the slopes of X&amp;X

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6585-3
00:43:10.007 --> 00:43:13.690
squared at two and the point of
five respectively.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6596-0
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.450
Multiple linear regression is
convenient tool.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6625-0
00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:28.611
Now I want to conclude our
discussion, but by now it should

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6625-1
00:43:28.611 --> 00:43:32.210
be clear to you this is
definitely not a guarantee.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6633-0
00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:35.600
You're statistical analysis is
going to be perfect.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6648-0
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.470
There is no guarantee that your
quantum research will be.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6652-0
00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:42.490
Perfect, right?

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6677-0
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:46.067
Because very often when we are
doing multiple linear

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6677-1
00:43:46.067 --> 00:43:50.106
regression, there are so many
things that are not black and

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6677-2
00:43:50.106 --> 00:43:50.510
white.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6716-0
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:55.684
There are many decisions we have
to take or we have to make as a

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6716-1
00:43:55.684 --> 00:43:59.379
quant social researcher and the
decisions we make may not have a

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6716-2
00:43:59.379 --> 00:44:00.800
clear answer or solution.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6748-0
00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:05.508
There are also many assumptions
we need to make, but we need to

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6748-1
00:44:05.508 --> 00:44:09.406
accept before we can obtain any
useful results, and some of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6748-2
00:44:09.406 --> 00:44:12.980
these assumptions can be
controversial or unrealistic.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6797-0
00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:19.921
Also, it is very important to
understand doing good quantum

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6797-1
00:44:19.921 --> 00:44:24.080
research requires a very solid
knowledge of the subject matter

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6797-2
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.041
and a very often we can only
obtain very solid knowledge of

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6797-3
00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:31.540
the subject matter with
qualitative Social Research.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6829-0
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.485
Here in this slide I put some
principles you can follow or

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6829-1
00:44:40.485 --> 00:44:44.690
consider and I'm not going to
read out of this one by one.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6840-0
00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:48.670
But the key lesson is there is
no perfect model.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6921-0
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:53.134
Nevertheless, note that by no
means invalidates on the

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6921-1
00:44:53.134 --> 00:44:57.783
analytical value of using linear
regression models to to study or

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6921-2
00:44:57.783 --> 00:45:02.009
understand the social world or
human behaviors, and it's in

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6921-3
00:45:02.009 --> 00:45:06.094
time you should be prepared that
any solid quantum Social

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6921-4
00:45:06.094 --> 00:45:10.039
Research where required you to
use multiple statistical

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6921-5
00:45:10.039 --> 00:45:14.547
techniques and only having your
table with one regression model

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6921-6
00:45:14.547 --> 00:45:18.210
including all predictors will
not get you very far.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6937-0
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.990
So I would like to end our
review by quoting George Box.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6978-0
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.727
Again, remember, statistical
models are only approximations

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6978-1
00:45:30.727 --> 00:45:35.691
of our real life, but there's
some very good approximations if

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6978-2
00:45:35.691 --> 00:45:40.182
we can think really, really
hard, because all models are

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6978-3
00:45:40.182 --> 00:45:42.310
wrong as put by George Box.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/6989-0
00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:47.100
But some of these are useful, so
this is the main.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/7007-0
00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:55.910
Idea of advanced topics in
quantitative Social Research.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/7011-0
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:57.440
Right.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/7039-0
00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:01.912
You have about 10 some very
basic understanding of multiple

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/7039-1
00:46:01.912 --> 00:46:06.326
linear regression and now it is
time to apply your knowledge

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/7039-2
00:46:06.326 --> 00:46:07.340
into practice.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/7098-0
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:11.080
And as we are trying to apply
multiple linear regression,

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/7098-1
00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:14.316
we're also going to introduce
some of more advanced

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/7098-2
00:46:14.316 --> 00:46:18.300
statistical techniques, while at
the same time we're also going

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/7098-3
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:22.159
to have a lot of opportunities
to discuss some very practical

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/7098-4
00:46:22.159 --> 00:46:25.769
issues when we try to implement
this analysis for our own

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/7098-5
00:46:25.769 --> 00:46:26.330
research.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/7104-0
00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:28.320
Thank you very much.

5de51504-c831-49ec-8b49-0a83445cdf7f/7114-0
00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:30.530
Again, I'm looking forward to
seeing you in class.
